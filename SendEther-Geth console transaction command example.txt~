web3.eth.sendTransaction({from: web3.eth.coinbase, to: '0x2d96cefbdec4c5a6ea88d9496fdeddefa561adcd', value: web3.toWei(1, 'ether'), gas:21000});"

^That command sends 1 ether to my desktop address "0x2d96cefbdec4c5a6ea88d9496fdeddefa561adcd" from "web3.eth.coinbase" which is the address the miner sends ether block rewards

Paste it into the geth console. It will look wierd with repeating rolling text and other matrixlike nonsense. I've tested it and it works. Just hit enter. It will prompt you to unlock the account with the passphrase so that it can send the ether.

Support the work, and send a cup of coffee my way with that command after you struck your first block reward!
