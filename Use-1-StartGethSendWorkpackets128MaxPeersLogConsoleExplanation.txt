geth --autodag //build dag, not needed?, but makes sure that you keep up with gas limits even if the official geth version changes. -rpc // Sends work packets to the miner, or whoever is listening --maxpeers "128" //Sets peers to 128. 256 could work too, but it takes a long time to build the peer connections. The more peers you have the greater the chance that you are credited with mining a block. console //starts geth console 2>>geth.log //logs console output (mined blocks, work done etc but NOT gpu hashrate) to "geth.log" Use Notepad++ to view properly.
